A function to calculate how many views a video can get or go viral on social media platforms like Instagram, YouTube, TikTok etc.

<aside>
1️⃣ Identify Variables:

- *V(t)* : Number of views on the video at time *t*
- *t* : Time since the video was posted
</aside>

2️⃣ Initial Observation - Exponential Growth

- Videos often experience rapid growth in views initially.
- Start with a standard exponential growth function:


$$V(t) = (V_0 \cdot e^{rt}) - 100$$


- Where *Vo* is the initial number of views, *r* is the growth rate.

3️⃣ Introduce Saturation Effect:

- Videos can't keep growing indefinitely; there's a limit to the number of potential viewers.
- Modify the function to include a saturation or maximum view  parameter:

$$ V(t) = V_{\text{max}} \times (1 - e^{-rt}) $$

</aside>

4️⃣ Parameter Interpretation:

- $V(t)$ : Number of views at time *t*.
- $V_{max}$ : Maximum achievable views (saturation level).
- $r$ : Growth rate, determining how fast the video approaches saturation.
- $t$ : Time since the video was posted.

5️⃣ Testing and Adjusting:

- Test your function with real-world data or hypothetical scenarios.
- Adjust parameters $(V_{max,\ \ \ r})$ to fit the observed or expected behavior.

Example variant function:

$$ V(t) = V_{max} \times (1-e^{-0.1t}) $$

</aside>

In this example, $V_{max}$ represents the maximum number of views the video can achieve, and 0.1 is the growth rate. 
These parameters would change based on the platform, type of video, historical data etc. For instance, growth rate 
and saturation level would be guided by the characteristics of the piece of content and the social media platform.
